Branch focuses on Astraphobia Level.

So after watching some tutorials monday, it became apparent what I was making wasn't feasible.
I did get an idea of how to fix that and started reconstructing things with that in mind, and I'm setting up things so protoyping is a little easier.
I made decent progress with that monday, but I ran into an issue trying to use deltaTime of framerates to keep track of when statues toggle on and off.
I'm commiting what I have in case you guys know what I'm doing wrong.
